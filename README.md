# Word Document Comment Counter

This VBA script is designed to count both unresolved and resolved comments in a Microsoft Word document. It's a simple yet effective tool for users who need to track the progress of document reviews and edits. I needed something to count the comments I had from my supervisors (in my PhD) and wrote this. I hope it helps someone out ther

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to implement and run the VBA script in your Microsoft Word environment.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of how to run VBA scripts in Word

### Installation

1. Open Microsoft Word and the document you want to analyze.
2. Press `Alt + F11` to open the Microsoft VBA editor.
